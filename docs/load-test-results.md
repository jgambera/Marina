## Summary

- Server handles 200+ concurrent WebSocket connections with zero errors
- Throughput scales linearly: ~300 cmd/s at 100 connections, ~1000 cmd/s at 200
- Round-trip latency stays well under 20ms even at p99 under heavy load
- Memory usage is modest: ~12MB heap, ~115MB RSS at peak
- Connection establishment is fast: p95 under 80ms even with 200 simultaneous connections
- Exceeds the target of 100+ concurrent connections with <100ms p95 latency
